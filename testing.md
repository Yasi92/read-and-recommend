# Read and Recommend Website - Testing in detils

[The Website In Action](https://read-and-recommend.herokuapp.com/)       
[Main README.md file](README.md)

## Validation

- [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)    was used to validate all the HTML files.
  * **Important Note** on the pages with the jinja template, the W3c validator throws many errors in regards to the syntax and variable names inserted by the jinja template.          
  For instance:
    - It does not allow curly braces in "href", "src" and "action" attributes and it considers it as an error.
    - It does not accept variable names inserted in for loops in the "ul" elements.
    - It does not allow the code wrapped in curly braces to be placed in an element such as "a" and it considers it as "bad value".      
- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the code in my style.css file.        
- The website has been tested with the Lighthouse for each page separately and on both desktop and mobile devices and, required actions have been taken to improve the functionality of the website as much as possible.
- Lighthouse was also used to check the overall performance of the website and as a way to improve the website performance.
                                  


| Bugs | Solutions |            
| ----------- | ----------- |   
| The back to top button did not always land on top of the footer as it intended when resizing the window without reloading the page. | This was solved by wrapping the variable that defines the footer's height in setInterval() function which runs every 500 milliseconds. |
| One of the challenges I faced in this project was styling the active links that point to a python view. The issue was originated from the fact that every time a link was clicked the whole page is refreshed and as a result, the applied style to the active links would disappear in a blink. | The issue was solved by using a built-in flask request.path attribute which was used to achieve this. |
| When testing the edit_book function, noticed that it does not check if the book title already exists in the database before updating the book and as a result, there was a high chance of duplicated books on the website. | I fixed this by adding a line of code before updating the book collection in the database which queries all the books with the same title and resets the form if there is one. |
| When testing the "edit_profile" and "edit_book" function in app.py, noticed that there is a bug in the code when I try to update any other fields than the title and username fields in the form. This happened since I was trying to avoid a duplicate username and title in those functions and as such, I would have reset the form if the title and username had already existed in the database. The main issue was that all the fields in the form were pre-filled and given a value from the database and, consequently the if statement would consider an untouched title and username as new data which already existed in the database. | I got around this issue by adding extra "elif" statements that check if the username and title from the database are equal to the value from the form and in that case, they won't be considered as "exsisting_user" and "exsisting_book" and this will allow to update the other fields. | 




| Known Issues | Causes |            
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The javascript does not run on IE 10 and earlier versions and as such the application does not run properly. | This is a browser issue on old versions of IE that do not have scripting enabled by default. |
| The back button on books.html does not return to the same scroll position on the previous page on Chrome, Edge, and Opera but perfectly works on Safari and Firefox.| According to my inquiry about this issue, this is a browser issue that has been reported by many users but has not been fixed yet.|
| The back to top button does not always land on top of the footer as intended when resizing the window without reloading the page. | This happens because the bottom position of the button is defined with javascript on ready document state. |
| The python code in some functions such as "edit_form" and "edit_profile" may be quite verbose and I believe it could have been more "DRY". | This has not been fixed as I believe it requires more experience and time to debug. |
