## Information Architecture <a id="data-info"></a>                 
---

### Database Choice <a id="db"></a>
* My personal preference for the database for this project would be SQL as it would suit this project better however, as one of the requirements for this milestone project was using a relational database as Mongodb, this was chosen as my database.


### Data Storage Types <a id="data-type"></a>
* The types of data stored in the database are:
    * ObjectId
    * String
    * Boolean
    * DateTime 


### Collections JSON format <a id="json-format"></a>
- [Review collection](static/readme-assets/review-example.json)                       
- [User collection](static/readme-assets/user-example.json)                       
- [Book collection](static/readme-assets/book-example.json)                     
- [Category collection](static/readme-assets/category-example.json)               
* The "username" is added to all collections except the category, to match the user who added books and reviews.
* I am aware of the fact that here I could have also get this done without creating an additional collection for "category", however, I have decided to do it in this way in order to be able to add extra categories to the collection bar in the future without the need of adding the relevant books first.
